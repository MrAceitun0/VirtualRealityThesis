# The Life of a Viking
This repository has the source code of a demo developed in Unity3D for my Bachelor's Thesis about Control Schemas in Virtual Reality videogames. It is a small project developed for the study of the thesis so it is not a complete game. In the repository, it can be found all the scripts and the project ready to be launched in Unity. It also contains the executable build done for Android. It is a playable build of the demo but it has only been tested in Oculus Quest 2, we cannot say 100% it will work in other versions or other HMDs. The game can also be played with an HMD connected to the computer playing the game via Unity.

The executable can also be found in [itch.io](https://mraceituno.itch.io/the-life-of-a-viking).
